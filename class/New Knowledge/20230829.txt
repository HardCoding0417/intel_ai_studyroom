16-bit Timer/Counter for PWM of certain frequency (by changing MAX)


Use Serial rather than Parallel due to its cheaper cost
    MSB is transmitted first

synchronous: use clock('s falling edge)
asynchronous: no clock
    IDLE(high) - Start bit(low 1 bit) - Data bits(5~9 bits) - Parity bit(to match odd/even)
    - Stop bit(s)(high 1/2 bit(s)) - Start bit or IDLE

Serial Data Line / Serial Clock Line: Initially high
rising edge or falling edge of SDL only when SCL is low
start: SCL high, SDL falling edge
end: SCL high, SDL rising edge (read datasheet for TWI)



unsigned in for loop
